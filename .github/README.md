# template-mod

This is the Team Catalyst Template Mod, a template repository for quick-starting development with [terraria-catalyst/catalyst](https://github.com/terraria-catalyst/catalyst).

Catalyst is a build toolchain and extension to the tModLoader ecosystem that facilitates monolithic/multi-project repositories that may contain multiple projects, including multiple mods.

## About Catalyst

Catalyst is a set of projects and MSBuild targets/props that make mod development quicker and easier. It provides features like access transformers, allows for non-standard project organization, features source generators, and more.

This template is specifically designed to integrate with it, so it isn't optional.
